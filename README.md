1. Top Section with Date-Based Search
The interface begins with a header titled "Astronomy Picture of the Day", providing users with a clear purpose. A date picker and blue "Search" button allow users to choose a specific date and view the corresponding astronomical image. The calendar dropdown offers a user-friendly way to select dates efficiently.

2. Image Display with Add to Favourites Option
Just below the header, the selected image is shown along with a brief description of the celestial object. There's an “Add To Favourites” button directly below, letting users easily save images they like. The button has a soft, rounded aesthetic that fits the overall clean design.

3. List of Saved Favourites
The lower section includes a clearly labeled "Favourites List" table. Each entry includes a reference number, image title, a thumbnail, and a delete icon for removal. The layout is uniform, ensuring that users can browse and manage their saved content with ease.

4. User Feedback on Removal
When a user clicks the delete icon, a confirmation message appears (e.g., “Are you sure you want to remove from favourites list?”). This prevents accidental deletions. A close icon on the message bar allows users to dismiss the warning, giving more control over their actions.

5. Simple and Clean Footer
At the bottom, a centered footer displays the copyright:
“© 2025, Ramneek”, offering a professional finish to the site while crediting the creator. The footer blends well with the overall layout, maintaining a minimal and modern feel.
